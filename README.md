Before we get too far along with our coding, we need to set up a file organization system for our repo. The end result of this project will be an HTML page or application, so we need to establish the proper folder structure accordingly. At a high level, here's what we'll do:

Create the index.html file.
Create a subfolder to hold the CSS file (style.css).
Create a subfolder for images.
Create a subfolder to hold JavaScript.
